# iOS Goodies

## iOS Goodies is currently on pause, at least until the end of 2021. Please don't submit new articles for the next edition.

**iOS Goodies** is a weekly newsletter containing the best<sup>[1](#footnote)</sup> links of the week for iOS developers. 

Hi there! I'm [Marius](https://twitter.com/marius_const). I'm an iOS developer who's been working in this industry for almost 10 years now. I'm passionate about what I do and I like to stay up to date with the latest news and trends on iOS development. Since I read a lot of articles about iOS development, it makes sense to gather them somewhere. I've "inherited" this newsletter in 2017 from [Rui](https://twitter.com/peres) and [Tiago](https://twitter.com/_tiagoalmeida), and since then I try to share the best articles of the week while keeping a focus on new voices in our community. If you are one of those new voices in our community, feel free to open a pull request and add your content, or just reach out [here](https://github.com/iOS-Goodies/iOS-Goodies/issues/new) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marius_const).

### How can I contribute?

Please read our [contributing guidelines](../master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [code of conduct](../master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). ðŸ˜„

We are quite happy when you share articles that you have seen here, if that happens, spread the love and mention us ([@iOSGoodies](https://twitter.com/iosgoodies))
