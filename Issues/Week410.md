Happy Thursday! Around this time, every year, Apple announces that the App Store Connect goes on holiday around Christmas. Not this year, though. For the first time, as far as I know, [App Store Connect submissions will be accepted through the holidays](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y4fgrhhe). They anticipate a high volume of submissions and reviews may take longer to complete during the holidays.
