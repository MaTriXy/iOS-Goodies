Happy Thursday! Apple's Tech Talks have been going on for a while now, they've already updated the schedule. I really like the way they are listening to feedback, adding more sessions and increasing their capacity. The most attended sessions will be run again, and the sign up has been split in two, with half the spots released once and half in a second time slot, to give an equal chance to people from different timezones to sign up. I think Apple is doing a very good job with those sessions and it's a rare opportunity to talk to Apple developers outside of WWDC. A recap of what's been going on so far and whats coming next can be found in [Tech Talks Digest: November 1](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=cl44858t)
